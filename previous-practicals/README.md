# networks
this repository stores the 2 practicalss implemented on networks labs
### p0 - socket tutorial
the first practical aims to some basic concepts, specifically, we are asked to implement the following:
- copy
- udp echo server
- tcp echo server
### p1 - web server
we are asked to develop a basic java web server capable of interacting with a web browser to navigate through a web site
(this implementation is incomplete & not very accurate... -_-UU)
