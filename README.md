# networks
this repository stores the 2 practicalss implemented on networks labs
### p0 - socket tutorial
the first practical aims to some basic concepts, specifically, we are asked to implement the following:
- implement an application on `es.udc.redes.tutorial.copy.Copy` for copying a file (with either text or binary content) in the local disk using data streams
the application will recieve two input parameters:
    `java es.udc.redes.tutorial.copy.Copy <source file> <destination file>`
- implement an application for obtaining the main properties of a file:
    - size
    - last modification date
    - name
    - extension
    - file type
    - absolute path
    the application will recieve one input parameter:
    `java es.udc.redes.tutorial.info.Info <source file>`
- udp echo server
- tcp echo server
### p1 - web server
we are asked to develop a basic java web server capable of interacting with a web browser to navigate through a web site
(this implementation is incomplete & not very accurate... -_-UU)
